          # Customize your Kubernetes configs

          Base kubernetes assets have been generated for deploying `My Cool App` to your kubernetes cluster.

          The next step will walk you through adding any last-mile customizations to kubernetes configurations
          before deploying them to your cluster.

          This will give you an opportunity to customize default configuration values,
          and add any additional kubernetes settings in a way that will preserve your
          customizations when pulling in upstream updates for `My Cool App`

          We recommend reviewing the kubernetes resources and making any tweaks to the defaults,
          especially to `config.yaml`.

          If you have `kubectl` configured locally, you can deploy `My Cool App` by running

              kubectl apply -f rendered.yaml
